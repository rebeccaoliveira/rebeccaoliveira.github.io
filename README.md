# Reby-Oliveira-Website

After learning & doing a few tutorials/courses on React for a few days, I decided to build my website, with a simple and clean template, to add different details with React.

## The plan

To create a website using tools that could help me to do something applying different tools and libraries, training all things that a learned until here.


## The work process

1. to set up a new website using [Gastby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).
2. to set up the interface with already existing components.
3. to modify some components according to what I wanted to show on screen, following the template that I drew.
4. to use components from [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/), to apply [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) together with [React](https://reactjs.org/).
5. to apply Styled-Components to create styles in all pages.  
6. to add Material UI in my projects
7. to save all project on [Github](https://github.com/), using command lines directly on a terminal.
8. to transform a website completely responsive.
.

## What I learned in the process

* how to refactor the code into separate components.  
* how to change styles using components coming from a library.
* how to find a solution for things that I never did before.
* to read the documentation, it's a good friend during the development
* ask help for experienced developers, to guide me to find the solution for tasks where I had some difficult to solve.
* I always have something new to learn. Always!
* in general, getting comfortable with using React & JSX.
* to save all new feature on Github
